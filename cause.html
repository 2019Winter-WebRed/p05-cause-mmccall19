        <h3> How Did This Happen?</h3>
        <p> In the 1990's, healthcare providers increasingly began to prescribe opioid pain relievers because big pharmaceutical companies assured that no one would become addicted. Because of this, a widespread misuse of these medications started to happen. It became noticeable that these medicines were in fact addictive and opioid overdose deaths started to increase. In 2017 alone, there were 47,000 deaths due to overdose and 1.7 million suffered from addiction. Almost half of the people addicted say they were addicted to heroin, a drug that even severely affects the city of Wilmington. </p>
            <br /> 
        <h3> A Solution </h3>
            <p> Every day more than 130 people die in the United States due to drug addiction and overdose. This epidemic is a national crisis that affects public health along with social and economic welfare. Luckily there are companies made to help this crisis. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is focusing on efforts of 5 main priorities to end the epidemic:</p>

        <h3> What am I doing to make a difference?</h3>
            <p> Addiction has not only affected my community but also my family. I have had some close family members fall to addiction. It is never good. When choosing career paths I knew I wanted to work in the medical field. I could not handle all of the gory sights in the operating room so I figured pharmacy was the right path for me. So many people become addicted due to opioid or substance abuse and I think it is the role of a pharmacist to make sure this doesn't happen. I want to save people from substance abuse. Although I am only one person, I believe I can save lives by teaching patients about different medications and prevent them from substance abuse or addiction.</p>
